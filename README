== About ==
This is sample hadoop application that counts overall average rating and first two weeks average rating
after movie release from netflix's prize sample data (not included)

== FileNameLineRecordReader and FileNameTextInputFormat ==
There is easier way to get file name from Map part, but I left these two classes
as a sample of custom RecordReader and InputFormat. Maybe someone find it useful.
